       " 'He came from a marketing background but wanted to promote the use of natural gas in the transport sector.',\n",
       " 'From the outset Mr Brand was the managing director of the company and provided his services in that capacity under successive agreements made between Energy and his private company, Martech International Pty Ltd (Martech).',\n",
       " '2 Energy grew to become a substantial public company with interests in gas and power projects in Australia and overseas, including Indonesia and India.',\n",
       " 'In 1999 however, it experienced financial difficulties.',\n",
       " 'Its share price dropped and its principal financier the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) advised that it was not prepared to refinance or renegotiate a $115 million facility which it had provided.',\n",
       " '3 Energy explored various options including asset sales.',\n",
       " 'In the end a new investor came to its rescue in the form of Energy World International Ltd (EWI), whose principal was Mr Stuart Elliott.',\n",
       " \"As an aspect of the restructuring that followed EWI's involvement, Mr Elliott replaced Mr Brand as managing director and Mr Brand became an executive director of the company.\",\n",
       " 'Ultimately, he resigned from the company in November 2001.',\n",
       " '4 The parting of the ways between Mr Brand and Energy has given rise to the present litigation.',\n",
       " \"Mr Brand's company, Martech, has made a variety of claims against Energy.\",\n",
       " 'One of the claims is for a shortfall of fees following its unilateral, but temporary, reduction in the fees paid under the service contract for the period from 1 March 2000 to 30 September 2000.',\n",
       " 'That shortfall is claimed at $71,663.65.',\n",
       " \"Martech also claims a substantial Termination Payment in excess of $800,000 which it says is due under the contract by reason of the change in Mr Brand's status from managing director to executive director and the change in his duties.\",\n",
       " 'Claims for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct are also made.',\n",
       " '5 For the reasons that follow, I consider that Martech is entitled to the shortfall in agreed fees for the period 1 March 2000 to 30 September 2000.',\n",
       " 'I do not consider that there is any entitlement to a Termination Payment.',\n",
       " 'Nor do I consider that any of the other causes of action brought by Martech have been made out.',\n",
       " '6 Energy and its subsidiary, Australian Energy Equity Ltd (AEE) cross-claim against Martech and Mr Brand arising out of a payment made in respect of a power station development in India.',\n",
       " 'This development is known as the Vypeen Combined Cycle Power Project (the Vypeen Project).',\n",
       " 'It is said that, in 1999, Mr Brand authorised a milestone payment in connection with the development of the Vypeen Project when the contractual condition of a Sale and Purchase Agreement, under which that payment had to be made, had not been satisfied.',\n",
       " 'The relevant condition was that approvals had been obtained from the Indian Government for the importation of condensate fuel for use as an interim fuel in the proposed power station.',\n",
       " 'A clearance given by one Ministry was later contradicted by another.',\n",
       " 'It is alleged that Mr Brand failed in his duty to Energy and AEE by authorising the payment without taking reasonable care or exercising due diligence to ensure that it was due.',\n",

       " \"'   2.\",\n",
       " 'When the conduct of the parties to an agreement is such that an agreement to terminate or abandon the former contract may be inferred or where their conduct creates an estoppel.',\n",
       " '160 The Agreement of May 1999 was in the nature of an employment agreement notwithstanding that it took the form of an agreement for the provision of services under a consultancy arrangement.',\n",
       " 'It is a particular application of the general case of consensual discharge by subsequent inconsistent agreement that an employment agreement may be discharged by sufficiently substantial change to the terms and conditions of employment.',\n",
       " \"In Chitty on Contracts (Vol 2, Sweet & Maxwell, 28 th ed, 1999) 39-152, it is said:   'A termination of a contract of employment by agreement occurs also where there is an agreed change in the terms and conditions of employment, for instance by way of promotion, which is sufficiently fundamental to constitute the rescission of the original contract and its replacement by a new contract in differing terms.\",\n",
       " \"'  161 In Quinn v Jack Chia (Australia) Ltd [2000] VSCA 75 ; [1992] 1 VR 567, Ashley J reviewed a number of authorities relating to changes to the terms of employment and when such changes would amount to discharge of a subsisting employment agreement.\",\n",
       " \"He accepted, at 576, the proposition in Federated Mutual Insurance Co of Australia Ltd v Sabine [1920] SALR 284 that:   '... where employer and employee agree to an alteration in the employee's duties and responsibilities which is profound, a court should be more ready to hold (unless the original contract of employment provided for the contingency) that a new contract has replaced the old; or at least that the old contract as varied, contained terms objectively appropriate to the new relationship created.\",\n",
       " \"'  162 A contract under which a person is employed, whether directly or through a corporate entity controlled by that person, may be discharged by sufficiently significant changes to the duties and/or the remuneration of the person so employed.\",\n",
       " 'A discharge will occur when the changes are significant, not able to be accommodated by the terms of the original contract and not contemplated by the parties when the original contract was made.',\n",
       " 'Whether there has been a discharge or a variation of the original agreement depends upon the intention of the parties discerned by reference to the terms of their second agreement.',\n",
       " \"It is as Dixon CJ and Fullagar J said in Tallerman 'a matter of degree'.\",\n",
       " \"163 In my opinion, Mr Elliott's appointment as managing director and chief executive officer of Energy on 29 September 2000 and Mr Brand's relinquishment of that office was of itself sufficient to constitute a discharge of the Agreement of May 1999.\",\n",
       " 'There was a very substantial difference between the office of managing director and executive director which supports the contention that objectively judged it was the intention of both parties to discharge the Agreement.',\n",
       " 'The complete terms upon which Mr Brand provided his services as an executive director thereafter were never expressly agreed between Martech and Energy.',\n",
       " 'Those terms and conditions would have to be considered in the context of the evolving commercial relationship between Mr Brand and Energy and their respective conduct.',\n",
       " 'Mr Brand played a significant part in defining them himself, not least by unilaterally varying downwards his annual fee.',\n",
       " \"164 I do not accept the submission by Martech that Mr Brand was 'removed' from office by Energy on 29 September 2000.\",\n",
       " 'While the circumstances at the time made the course that he adopted the only practical course to take, that was a judgment he made for himself and to which he assented.',\n",
       " 'I find that the Agreement was discharged consensually.',\n",
       " '165 Martech submitted that it was entitled to the Termination Payment if the Agreement were terminated for any reason other than one of those set out in sub cls 8.1.1, 8.1.3, 8.1.4 and 8.1.5 or cl 8.5.',\n",
       " 'Termination having occurred on 29 September 2000 for none of those reasons it says it was entitled.',\n",
       " 'Energy submitted that, on its proper construction, cl 8.6 did not apply where Martech wished to terminate its services and agreed to termination.',\n",
       " 'The benefit of the notice provision in cl 8.5 could be waived --- Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 543, 552, 560 and 565.',\n",
       " \"166 The critical question in considering the Martech submission is whether, on the proper construction of cl 8.6, the entitlement which it creates in a case in which the 'Agreement is terminated for any other reason ...' arises where there is a consensual discharge of the Agreement.\",\n",
       " 'That constructional question depends upon a consideration of the words of cl 8.6 and the context in which they appear both within that clause and within other parts of cl 8 and the Agreement as a whole.',\n",
       " \"167 The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of 'termination' is equivocal.\",\n",
       " \"It defines termination relevantly as a transitive verb meaning:   'bring to an end, put an end to, cause to cease; finish, end (an action, condition etc).\",\n",
       " '\\'  It is also defined as an intransitive verb meaning, inter alia:    \\'come to an end (in time); end, cease, conclude ...\\'  168 Lord Radcliffe said in Bridge v Campbell Discount Co Ltd [1962] AC 600 (at 620):  \\'\"Terminate\" is an ambiguous word, since it may refer to a termination by a right under the agreement or by a condition incorporated in it or by a deliberate breach by one party amounting to a repudiation of the whole contract.',\n",
       " \"'  Lord Denning also adverted to the uncertain scope of 'termination' in the terms and conditions of National Health Service staff contracts:   'terminate or termination is by itself ambiguous.\",\n",
       " 'It can refer to either of two things --- either to termination by notice or termination by effluxion of time.',\n",
       " 'It is often used in that dual sense in landlord and tenant and master and servant cases.',\n",
       " \"'  In context, he found it to refer only to termination by notice --- R v Social Services Secretary, Ex parte Khan [1973] 1 WLR 187 at 189.\",\n",
       " 'Karminski and Buckley LJJ agreed.',\n",
       " 'Buckley LJ added (at 191):   \\'As Mr Slynn has pointed out, the verb \"terminate\" can be used either transitively or intransitively.',\n",
       " 'A contract may be said to terminate when it comes to an end by effluxion of time, or it may be terminated when it is determined by notice or otherwise by some act of one of the parties.',\n",
       " \"'  169 There is no doubt that the word 'terminate' used in a written contract, in reference to its discharge, is capable of extending to the case in which the contract is discharged by agreement.\",\n",
       " \"This usage was recognised by Professor Carter in his identification of what he called 'the three principal bases for saying that a contract has been terminated'.\",\n",
       " 'They were:  1.',\n",
       " 'Subsequent agreement by the parties.',\n",
       " 'Exercise of a right to terminate.',\n",
       " 'Frustration of the contract.',\n",
       " '(Carter op cit at 1317).',\n",
       " 'Termination by agreement as he pointed out, is sometimes referred to as rescission by agreement.',\n",
       " \"170 It is necessary then to consider the way in which the word 'terminate' was used in cl 8.6 of the Agreement in order to determine whether it extended to rescission by agreement.\",\n",
       " 'In so doing it is necessary to have in mind the consequences of termination.',\n",
       " \"As Carter observed (op cit at 1319):   'The feature which serves to distinguish termination by agreement from termination for breach is that the former will generally discharge both the primary and secondary obligations of the parties.\",\n",
       " 'In the latter context, only the primary obligations are discharged and accrued obligations or liabilities (giving rise to secondary obligations) are not divested.',\n",
       " 'However, when the subsequent agreement is intended to release one party from a liability (or an alleged liability) the general principle is that the party in default is released from those accrued obligations or liabilities only if consideration has been given for the release.',\n",
       " \"'  171 A contract may be abandoned by agreement extinguishing all unperformed primary obligations.\",\n",
       " 'It may be abandoned by conduct where the conduct of one party acted on by the other leads to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract.',\n",
       " \"In the alternative, the conduct of one party towards another and the other's action upon that conduct to its detriment may result in the first party being estopped from denying that the contract has been abandoned --- Paal Wilson & Co v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 914 (Lord Brandon), 915 (Lord Diplock), 924 (Lord Brightman).\",\n",
       " \"172 In summary the word 'termination' when referring to the discharge of a contract has a variety of possible meanings.\",\n",
       " 'It may be limited to non-consensual termination by the action of one or other party to the contract.',\n",
       " 'It may extend to discharge of the contract by effluxion of time.',\n",
       " 'That is a consensual termination in the limited sense that it is part of the agreement from the outset.',\n",
       " 'The word may also be construed as applying to a discharge of a contract by agreement or by abandonment which may be taken to amount to the same thing.',\n",
       " 'Its meaning in cl 8.6 depends upon the language of that clause and related clauses of the Agreement.',\n",
       " 'It is also to be construed by reference to the context of the Agreement as a whole.',\n",
       " \"173 Clause 8.1 of the Agreement concerned the circumstances in which Energy could terminate summarily Martech's services.\",\n",
       " 'None of those circumstances applied in this case.',\n",
       " 'Clause 8.2 allowed Martech to terminate the Agreement in the event of Energy suspending payment or compounding with its creditors or assigning its estate for their benefit.',\n",
       " 'That circumstance did not exist either.',\n",
